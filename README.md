Portfolio website 1.0
=====================
March 2024, Berlin.

This portfolio website is an exercise from the front-end curiculum of [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/). I don't have any projects to present yet so it's only a *homepage*, a *biography*, a *contact page*, and a *blog* where I will document the process and share the ressources that will help me in my journey. 

Here's a list of requirements:
* Build a website using HTML, CSS
* Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use the command line and file navigation
* Develop locally on your computer
* Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages
